What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The staging area is what you plan on adding to the commit. The working directory
is what you currently have, but you might not want to add all of that to the
commit and all of the files there might not be conceptually related. The files
you add to the staging area will eventually be part of the commit stored in the
repository.
